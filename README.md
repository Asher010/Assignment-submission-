we define a constant for the gravitational acceleration using the final keyword to make it a constant value that cannot be changed. 
we've defined a public class Physics that contains a public constant variable GRAVITY and a public static method getGravity() that returns the value of GRAVITY 
we've defined a public class Energy that contains five public static methods that each use Physics.getGravity() to access the value of the gravitational constant.

By using the Physics.getGravity() method to access the gravitational constant, we can ensure that all of our energy formulas use the same value for gravity, making our code easier to use
